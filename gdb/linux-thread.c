/* This module implements the debugging interface of the linuxthreads package
   of the glibc. This package implements a simple clone()-based implementation
   of Posix threads for Linux. To use this module, be sure that you have at
   least the version of the linuxthreads package that holds the support of
   GDB (currently 0.8 included in the glibc-2.0.7).

   Right now, the linuxthreads package does not care of priority scheduling,
   so, neither this module does; In particular, the threads are resumed
   in any order, which could lead to different scheduling than the one
   happening when GDB does not control the execution.

   The latest point is that ptrace(PT_ATTACH, ...) is intrusive in Linux:
   When a process is attached, then the attaching process becomes the current
   parent of the attached process, and the old parent has lost this child.
   If the old parent does a wait[...](), then this child is no longer
   considered by the kernel as a child of the old parent, thus leading to
   results of the call different when the child is attached and when it's not.

   A fix has been submitted to the Linux community to solve this problem,
   which consequences are not visible to the application itself, but on the
   process which may wait() for the completion of the application (mostly,
   it may consider that the application no longer exists (errno == ECHILD),
   although it does, and thus being unable to get the exit status and resource
   usage of the child. If by chance, it is able to wait() for the application
   after it has died (by receiving first a SIGCHILD, and then doing a wait(),
   then the exit status and resource usage may be wrong, because the
   linuxthreads package heavily relies on wait() synchronization to keep
   them correct.  */
