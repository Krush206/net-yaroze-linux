              Host/Target specific installation notes for egcs
                                      
   alpha*-*-*
   No specific installation needs/instructions.
   
   i?86-*-linux*
   You will need binutils-2.8.1.0.15 or newer for exception handling to
   work.
   
   i?86-*-sco3.2v5*
   The SCO assembler is currently required. The GNU assembler is not up
   to the task of switching between ELF and COFF at runtime.
   Unlike various prereleases of GCC, that used '-belf' and defaulted to
   COFF, you must now use the '-melf' and '-mcoff' flags to toggle
   between the two object file formats. ELF is now the default.
   Look in gcc/config/i386/sco5.h (search for "messy") for additional
   OpenServer-specific flags.
   Systems based on OpenServer before 5.0.4 (uname -X will tell you what
   you're running) require TLS597 from ftp.sco.com/TLS for C++
   constructors and destructors to work right.
   
   i?86-pc-solaris*
   You'll need a patch to fix an egcs bug on this platform. [1]x86
   solaris patch
   
   hppa*-hp-hpux*
   We highly recommend using gas/binutils-2.8 on all hppa platforms; you
   may encounter a variety of problems when using the HP assembler.
   
   hppa*-hp-hpux9
   The HP assembler has major problems on this platform. We've tried to
   work around the worst of the problems. However, those workarounds may
   be causing linker crashes in some circumstances; the workarounds also
   probably prevent shared libraries from working. Use the GNU assembler
   to avoid these problems.
   The configuration scripts for egcs will also trigger a bug in the
   hpux9 shell. To avoid this problem set CONFIG_SHELL to /bin/ksh and
   SHELL to /bin/ksh in your environment.
   
   hppa*-hp-hpux10
   For hpux10.20, we highly recommend you pick up the latest sed patch
   from HP. HP has two sites which provide patches free of charge.
   [2]US, Canada, Asia-Pacific, and Latin-America
   [3]Europe
   
   Retrieve patch PHCO_12862.
   
   The HP assembler on these systems is much better than the hpux9
   assembler, but still has some problems. Most notably the assembler
   inserts timestamps into each object file it creates, causing the
   3-stage comparison test to fail during a "make bootstrap". You should
   be able to continue by saying "make all" after getting the failure
   from "make bootstrap".
   
   m68k-*-nextstep*
   You absolutely must use GNU sed and GNU make on this platform.
   
   If you try to build the integrated C++ & C++ runtime libraries on this
   system you will run into trouble with include files. The way to get
   around this is to use the following sequence. Note you must have write
   permission to prefix for this sequence to work.
   
   cd objdir
   make all-texinfo all-bison all-byacc all-binutils all-gas all-ld
   cd gcc
   make bootstrap
   make install-headers-tar
   cd ..
   make bootstrap3
   
   m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
   It is reported that you may need the GNU assembler on this platform.
   
   mips*-sgi-irix4
   mips*-sgi-irix5
   You must use GAS on these platforms, the native assembler can not
   handle the code for exception handling support on this platform.
   
   These systems don't have ranlib, which various components in egcs
   need; you should be able to avoid this problem by installing GNU
   binutils, which includes a functional ranlib for this system.
   
   You may get the following warning on irix4 platforms, it can be safely
   ignored.

    warning: foo.o does not have gp tables for all its sections.

   mips*-sgi-irix6
   You must not use GAS on irix6 platforms; doing so will only cause
   problems.
   
   These systems don't have ranlib, which various components in egcs
   need; you should be able to avoid this problem by making a dummy
   script called ranlib which just exits with zero status and placing it
   in your path.
   
   rs6000-ibm-aix*
   powerpc-ibm-aix*
   At least one person as reported problems with older versions of
   gnu-make on this platform. make-3.76 is reported to work correctly.
   
   powerpc-*-linux-gnu*
   You will need [4]binutils-2.8.1.0.23 for a working egcs. It is
   strongly recommended to recompile binutils with egcs if you initially
   built it with gcc-2.7.2.*.
   
   sparc-unkonwn-linux-gnulibc1
   It has been reported that you might need binutils-2.8.1.0.23 for this
   platform too. [5]binutils-2.8.1.0.23
