                             Final install egcs
                                      
   Now that egcs has been built and tested, you can install it with `cd
   objdir; make install' for a native compiler or `cd objdir; make
   install LANGUAGES="c c++"' for a cross compiler (note installing cross
   compilers will be easier in the next release!).
   
   That step completes the installation of egcs; user level binaries can
   be found in prefix/bin where prefix is the value you specified with
   the --prefix to configure (or /usr/local by default).
   
   If you don't mind, please send egcs@cygnus.com a short mail message
   indicating that you successfully built and installed egcs. Include the
   output from running srcdir/config.guess.
   
   If you find a bug in egcs, please report it to
   [1]egcs-bugs@cygnus.com.
