   This document describes the generic installation procedure for egcs as
   well as detailing some target specific installation instructions for
   egcs.
   
   egcs includes several components that previously were separate
   distributions with their own installation instructions. This document
   supercedes all package specific installation instructions. We provide
   the component specific installation information in the source
   distribution for historical reference purposes only.
   
   We recommend you read the entire generic installation instructions as
   well as any target specific installation instructions before you
   proceed to configure, build, test and install egcs.
   
   If something goes wrong in the configure, build, test or install
   procedures, first double check that you followed the generic and
   target specific installation instructions carefully. Then check the
   [1]FAQ to see if your problem is covered before you file a bug report.
   
   The installation procedure is broken into four steps.
     * [2]configure
     * [3]build
     * [4]test (optional)
     * [5]install
       
   Before starting the build/install procedure please browse the
   [6]host/target specific installation notes.
